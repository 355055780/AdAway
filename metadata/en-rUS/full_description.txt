An ad blocker that uses the hosts file and local vpn. 

The hosts file is a system file that contains a list of mappings between host names and IP addresses.
When an app requests an ad from a host in that file, this request is redirected to the local IP 127.0.0.1, which does nothing.
You can download predefined hosts files from within the app to incorporate them into the system's hosts file. It is also possible to use your own files and to add certain hosts to allowed and blocked lists.
Updating your system hosts file required a rooted device. If your device is not rooted, the application creates a local vpn to block connections. The vpn is not connected to any server and will directly route your traffic to your network connection.  

There are options to run a local web server to respond to blocked host names and to direct requests to the IP address of your choosing instead.
